## Computer Structure

| Information which computer can understantd | Four key parts of computer |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |

### ▪  Information which computer can understand

| Data | Command |
|:----:| ------- |

#### -  Data

- Number, string, img, video etc

- Saved Information inner computer

#### -  Command

- Information which computer carry out 

____

### ▪  Four key parts of computer

| CPU | Memory | Secondary memory unit | input-output unit |
|:---:| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------- |

#### - Memory

> Device to save data and command of program running at present

- memory location
  
  - we must know  memory location to know where is information

#### - CPU

> Device to read command saved in memory, interpret,  and carry out

| ALU        | Register      | Control unit                               |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| calculator | memory in CPU | send **control signal**, interpret command |

- control signal
  
  - electronic siganl to run computer's divice
  
  - like read memory, write memory stuff

#### - Secondary memory unit

This don't loss the memory if power off

#### - Input-output unit

monitor, keyboard, mouse, speaker, scanner etc..

So, how to exchange information these each other?

#### - Bus

CPU, memory stuff connected by mainboard are exchange information by **BUS**

There are many kinds of Bus

**System bus** connects the Core unit together

- **System bus**
  
  - address bus
    
    - path of exchages address
  
  - data bus
    
    - path of exchage command and data
  
  - control bus
    
    - path of exchange control signal
