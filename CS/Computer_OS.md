OS is in memory, but it's exist in special space called kernel

the other memory called user area

and other program likes internet, game stuff is in user area

OS manage memory, if program run, OS load memory to run program



Program need CPU to run, 

if running program is more than two, OS alternately allot CPU to program



In the same way,  program need resource to run

OS protect resource by program want use resource

OS accesses a resource Instead of program
