## Domain Name System (= DNS)

DNS Server is the White Pages simply

there is no way One DNS server can handle whole request from all divices

the answer is DNS server are connected in a distributed hierarchy and divided into zones splitting up responsiblility for the major domains such as `.org` `.com``.net`



DNS was created to be an open public communication  for government and educational institutions, because of it opeenness Dns is susceptible to cyber attacks

an example attack is dns spoofing that's when a hacker taps into a dns server and changes it to match a domain name with the wrong ip address 

this lets th attacker send people to one imposter website

if this happens to you you are vulnerable for more problems because you are using fake websie as if it is real
